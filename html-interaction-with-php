HTML and PHP work together to create dynamic web pages. Hereâ€™s how they interact:

1. PHP is a Server-Side Language, HTML is a Client-Side Language
HTML is used to structure web pages and is interpreted by the browser.
PHP runs on the server, processes data, and generates dynamic HTML.
2. Embedding PHP in HTML
PHP code can be placed inside an HTML file using <?php ... ?>.
When a user visits the page, the server executes PHP first and then sends the resulting HTML to the browser.
